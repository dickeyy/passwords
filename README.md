## Motivation

Password managers are an essential tool for anyone online. However, the centralized nature of a
cloud-based password manager is a huge security risk. For this reason, self-hosted alternatives
exist! You can host it on your own servers and you own the data. While this approach is _safer_ than
a cloud-based solution, it still has the same centralized nature. These self-hosted alternatives are
also much more difficult to set up, have worse UI/UX, and are often not as feature-rich as their
cloud-based counterparts.

This project aims to solve these problems. Passwords.so provides an easy-to-use self-hosting
solution that _anyone_ can set up. It is free, open-source, and not _as_ centralized as a
cloud-based solution. However, it still is one central location for your passwords. Passwords.so has
a beautiful and simple UI and aims to match all features of the bigger providers.

Passwords.so is the safest approach to password management, and doesn't compromise on beauty and
ease of use.
